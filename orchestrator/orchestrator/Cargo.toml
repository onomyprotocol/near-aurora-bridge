# this is a dirty trick, we depent transitively on OpenSSL it's never
# called directly in this crate, but if we specify this dep we can enable
# this feature for all the crates in our dependency tree which depend on
# this crate. This allows for easy cross compiled builds because the 'vendored'
# feature includes it's own OpenSSL version that's compiled on the fly
# If ANY crate in this workspace has this it will work for all of them.
